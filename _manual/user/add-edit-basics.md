### The Basics Tab

In the following example, we'll add a new show called "The Good Doctor" to TV Rename.

![Add/Edit Show - Search Results]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/main-window/add-edit-show-basics-02.png){:.pic-r}
The first step is to tell TV&nbsp;Rename about the show. If you know it you can enter TheTVDB's code for the show, otherwise type the shows name (e.g. "the good doctor") and click on `Search`. TV&nbsp;Rename will search for matches to your entry in TheTVDB's database, cache the results locally and display the matches. The search also works with partial show names. For example you could search for just "doctor", but "doctor" being fairly common in tv show titles, returns over 80 results (including ours!), and you will have to delve into the list to find the one you want. Once you have found the correct show, click on it to highlight it.

If all you want to do is see the details of the show then you're done! Just click `OK` at the bottom of the window and TV&nbsp;Rename will pull the necessary data from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com") to populate the _**My Shows**_ tab.

Once the update is complete _**My Shows**_ includes "The Good Doctor" and looks like this: -

![My Shows - New Show Added]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/main-window/my-shows-02.png){:.pic-c}

All the Show and Season information is downloaded and the _**When to Watch**_ tab will now list any future episode dates, but there are no links to the media library.

Lets go back and tweak "The Good Doctor" to include it in the library. Assuming the show is listed in _**My Shows**_, make sure it is highlighted and click `Edit` to recall the partially populated *Add/Edit Show*. If it isn't listed in _**My Shows**_ follow the steps above to get the show name populated and then carry on as described below. 

The "Custom show name:" field allows you to change the shows name in both TV&nbsp;Rename and the media library (except the base folder). You may like to remove "The" from names, or change extra information like the year the show was originally produced that appears with some shows. If you tick the box and enter a new name in the field provided the shows title will be replaced with this entry.

The "Airs in Timezone:" drop-down tells TV&nbsp;Rename that the air time from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com") is in that specific timezone. Most shows are in Eastern USA time, but British shows (e.g. Maigret) will be in British Standard Time. This only has an effect in the _**When to Watch**_ tab which translates these times into your local timezone, or in the status bar when calculating time till the "Next Airing:".

*Default:* _**Eastern Standard Time**_

If you wish to ignore specific seasons of a show enter the season numbers (space separated) in the "Ignore Seasons:" field (Entering a "0" will ignore "Specials").

*Default:* _**Empty Field**_ 

Ticking "Automatic Folders:" will tell TV&nbsp;Rename to automatically create folders as needed within the Base Folder.

*Default:* _**Ticked**_ 

Completing "Base Folder:" starts the magic! The path to the base folder for "The Good Doctor" can be typed in the text box or filled in by browsing, but either way, now TV&nbsp;Rename knows about the location of the shows base folder in the media library all the "really useful" stuff can begin!

The "Folder per season" tick box and "base name:" text box go together. If the tick box is un-ticked TV&nbsp;Rename will assume that all the files related to "The Good Doctor" reside in the base folder, if the box is ticked and a name is provided then TV&nbsp;Rename assumes there are sub folders for each season and will create them if "Automatic Folders: is ticked.

| *Defaults:* | "Folder per season" | _**Ticked**_ |
| | "Base name:" | _**"Season"**_ |

The final entry in this tab is the "Pad season number to two digits" tick box. un-ticked (with the default base name) the season would be: -

Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, Season 4 etc.

If the box is ticked: -

Season 01, Season 02, Season 03, Season 04 etc.

would be used instead.

*Default:* _**Un-ticked**_ 

Don't forget to click `OK` when you're done.

_**These settings are the minimum required by TV&nbsp;Rename to manage your media library,**_ 

However TV&nbsp;Rename's middle name is "configurability", so lets take a look at the other *Add/Edit Show* tabs.
