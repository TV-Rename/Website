### The Search Tab

![The Search Tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/main-window/add-edit-show-search-01.png){:.pic-l}
The Search Tab allows you to create a custom search for files on a per show basis.

This is useful if you collect episodes of a show that falls outside the scope of the "general" search engines and has its own genre-specific sites and searches (Japanese Anime for example).

Using the same technique and tag structure as found in the [Options>Search&nbsp;Engines](options#search-engines "Visit Options>Search Engines") tab you can create a search specific to the show without affecting the "general" searches.

This option is disabled by default but it can be enabled for the specific show by ticking the "Use Custom Search" box in the tab.
