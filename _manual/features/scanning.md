## Scanning

### Functionality

#### Scan Types
There are 4 types of scan:

* _Single Show_ – A single show can be scanned manually.

* _Quick Scan_ - A ‘clever’ scan that looks in the download directory for shows to scan. It also scans missing episodes from the recent list. <Recommended>

* _Recent Scan_ – A scan that looks at all shows that have had an episode aired in the last few days. The number of days can be specified in the preferences.

* _Full Scan_ – Scans all shows that are set to be scanned.

#### Triggering Scans

These can be triggered in several ways:

* On Startup

* Via Command Line

* Periodic (Automated)

* When download/search folder/file changes

* Manually 

### Further Information

* Configuration options are detailed in [**Options>Preferences>Scan Options**](/manual/options#the-scan-options-tab "Read about Scan Options")

* Further explanation can be found [**here**](/manual/user#scan "Read about Scanning").

### Future Ideas
* To incorporate a ‘Bulk add’ as part of the scan and use the new ‘Quick Add’ Dialog to quickly add missing shows.
