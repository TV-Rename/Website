## Exporting

### Functionality

| **Type** | **Formats** | **Description** |
| When&nbsp;to&nbsp;Watch | RSS,&nbsp;XML | Details all the upcoming episodes so that you know what episodes are going to air soon. Output whenever information from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com 'Visit thetvdb.com') about airdates is updated. 
| Missing | XML,&nbsp;CSV | Whenever a full scan is executed TV Rename outputs details of all missing episodes. |
| Renamed&nbsp;files | XML | For each scan TV Rename can provide a summary of all renamed files. |
| Copied&nbsp;and&nbsp;Moved&nbsp;files | XML | For each scan TV Rename can provide a summary of all moved/copied files. |
| Show&nbsp;List | TXT,&nbsp;HTML | Whenever a show is added or removed from the library TV Rename will update the show list file. The HTML version is a pretty output designed to be printed and viewable by users to help decide what to watch |
