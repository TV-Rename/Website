<!-- START SHOW SUMMARY GRID ----------------- -->
## Show Summary

Show Summary displays a table of the shows in your database with traffic light style colouring to indicate the status of a season of a show (_including Specials as their own season_).

![Show Summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/view/show-summary-01.png){:.pic-c}

The colouring is as follows: -

| **Green** | Indicates a season of a show that is complete. |
| **Light&nbsp;Green** | Indicates a season of a show which is ongoing. The numbers in brackets indicates the number of up-coming shows found in **When to watch**. |
| **Orange** | Indicates a season whose broadcast is complete but you don't have all the available episodes in the library. |
| **Red** | Indicates a season whose broadcast is complete but you have no episodes.
| **Blue** | Indicates a season which you have told TV&nbsp;Rename to ignore. |

The data can also be filtered using the tick boxes at the top of the pane if required.
