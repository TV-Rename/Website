## Repairing Corrupt Data

Occasionally information for shows gets corrupted and needs refreshing. The quickest way to do this is a "Forced Refresh", which comes in two flavours.

Firstly, if the problem is small, only effecting a small number of shows, right clicking a problematic show on the _**My Shows**_ tab will pop up a menu on which one of the options is "Force&nbsp;Refresh". Clicking this option will tell TV&nbsp;Rename to go to [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com") and re-collect all the data available for that show and re-populate the local cache. This will often fix the issue.

The second solution is far more drastic in its effect.

"Force Refresh All" in the **Tools** menu is the "Tool of Last Resort". If TV&nbsp;Rename's representation of your media library is a real mess or the previous solution doesn't help then this is your only real alternative.

After selecting the option from the menu you are presented with the alert window (shown).

**READ IT CAREFULLY AND PAY ATTENTION**. If you click `Yes` there's no going back, all the locally stored information in TheTVDB's cache will be **DELETED**.

The _**My Shows**_ tab reverts to showing The&nbsp;TVDB codes instead of show names, indicating that the relevant data has been deleted. Whilst still on the _**My Shows**_ tab click the `Refresh` button and the show data will be downloaded again. (Now might be a good time for a coffee, if your library is large and internet connection slow it may take a while!)

Once the download is complete all your shows will re-appear by name.
