### The Bulk / Auto Add Tab

![Preferences - the Bulk/Auto Add Tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-bulk-auto-add-01.png){:.pic-l}
The _**Bulk/Auto Add**_ tab provides access to settings for both **Tools>Bulk Add Shows** and the **Preferences>Scan Options - Additional Actions: Notify when new shows are found** preference.

Looking at the *Bulk Add:* section, two options are available and they both work as "junk filters".

Firstly, *Only Include Folders containing Video Files* if ticked restricts the "Bulk Add" scan to only include folders with video files.

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

And Secondly, *Ignore Recycle Bin* tells the "Bulk Add" scan to exclude the (Windows) Recycle Bin even if it contains video files.

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

And Finally, *Force to Use Season Words from Settings only* tells the "Bulk Add" scan to just use the words entered in the preferences when it is scanning to decide whether the series has a flat structure or a 'folder by season' structure.

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

The *Auto Add:* section comes in to play when the **Preferences>Scan Options - Additional Actions: Notify when new shows are found** option is ticked.

The "Movie Terms:" box helps TV Rename identify "types" of video file.

_Default:_ _**dvdrip;camrip;screener;dvdscr;r5;bluray**_

And the "Ignore Suffixes:" box tells TV Rename to ignore the specified suffixes.

_Default_ _**1080p;720p**_
