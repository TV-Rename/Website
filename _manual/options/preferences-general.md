"X" _days count as recent_ specifies how many recent days are listed for the for "Aired in the last N days" section of the _**[When to watch]({{ site.baseurl }}/manual/user#when-to-watch "Read about When to Watch")**_ tab.

The *Show Notification Area* and *Show in Taskbar* interact, one of them **must** be ticked. If you try to un-tick both the option you are changing clears, but the other one automatically sets.

If *Show in Taskbar* is selected TV&nbsp;Rename's icon appears in the Windows taskbar.<br />
If *Show Notification Area* is selected TV&nbsp;Rename's icon appears in the System Tray. Right-clicking it will show an "Upcoming Shows" list, and double clicking restores the main window.<br />
Both boxes can be ticked, in which case you get both functionalities.

| *Defaults:* | "Show Notification Area" | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| | "Show in Taskbar" | _**Ticked**_ |

*Show episode pictures in episode guides* Does what-it-says-on-the-tin, if ticked screen grabs from show episodes are displayed with the episode description in the _**My&nbsp;Shows**_ tab. If un-ticked only the episode description is displayed.

*Automatically select show and season in My&nbsp;Shows*

_Default:_ _**Ticked**_

*Look for air date in filenames*
If ticked this provides a second method of identifying show episodes by looking for a date (in a number of formats) in the shows filename and comparing that against the air-date.

The supported date formats are:

"yyyy-MM-dd", "dd-MM-yyyy", "MM-dd-yyyy", "yy-MM-dd", "dd-MM-yy" and "MM-dd-yy"

And the "date separators" can be any of: - / . , " " (a space)

_Default:_ _**Un-ticked**_

The _Preferred language:_ drop-down sets the language for returned data when requesting information from TheTVDB API. TV&nbsp;Rename will request "English" If the selected language is not available.

The _Mode:_ drop-down, (new in Version 2.3.2) allows you to preview functionality that is being worked on but not yet ready for the mainstream releases. The options available are “Production” and “Beta”.

In Production mode the application looks and behaves as normal.

In Beta mode a new menu called Beta appears between Tools and Help which gives you access to preview upcoming additions and enhancements.

Default: Production
