One of TV&nbsp;Rename's strongest (and most confusing) features is its configurability. For the newcomer especially, it's very easy to get "lost" in the plethora of options and preferences, and give up.

Luckily the "out-of-the-box" defaults work well, and, should you wish to change any of the options or preferences at some future time all the stuff you can "fiddle" with is described here.
