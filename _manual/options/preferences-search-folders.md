### The Search Folders Tab

![Preferences - the Search Folders tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/preferences-search-folders-02.png){:.pic-l}
The _**Search Folders**_ tab is used to tell TV&nbsp;Rename where to look for TV show episode files BEFORE they are processed. Logical entries in here would be your downloads folder (if you download TV show episodes from the internet) or maybe your desktop (if you rip TV show episodes from DVD or Blu-ray). Or both!

Three buttons are available at the bottom of the tab. `Add` opens an explorer style window so you can browse to the folder location you wish to add and click `OK`, `Remove` removes a highlighted row from the panel and `Open` opens an explorer window targeting the row highlighted in the panel.

| *Defaults* | | |
| | Look in "Search Folders" for missing files | _**Ticked**_ |
| | Copy files, don't move | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| | Automatically create merge rules based on files in Search Folders | _**Un-ticked**_ |
| | "Monitor folders for changes" | _**Un-ticked**_ |

The *Auto Add:* section comes in to play when the **Preferences>Scan Options - Additional Actions: Notify when new shows are found** option is ticked.

The "Movie Terms:" box helps TV Rename identify "types" of video file.

_Default:_ _**dvdrip;camrip;screener;dvdscr;r5;bluray**_

And the "Ignore Suffixes:" box tells TV Rename to ignore the specified suffixes.

_Default_ _**1080p;720p**_

| *Defaults* | | |
| | Update episodes when higher quality ones found | _**Un-ticked**_ |

The final two options help TV&nbsp;Rename when replacing videos that already exist in the library.

The "Priority override terms:" text box defines the "hints" used to determine if a video has been improved at source.

_Default:_ _**PROPER;REPACK;RERIP**_ (Note the semicolon delimiter).

"Consider a file better if it is **X%** higher resolution/longer tells TV&nbsp;Rename to replace an existing library file if the newly found version is higher resolution and/or longer.

_Default:_ _**10**_%
