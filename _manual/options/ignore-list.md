## Ignore List

![The Edit Ignore List window]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/options/edit-ignore-list-01.png){:.pic-l}
When a _**Scan**_ is run any "missing" episodes for shows in your media library are listed.

These may be genuine missing episodes or they may be "Specials", that don't fit the season/episode pattern but are still part of the show, for example: -

{:.clear}
> My Favourite Show - S00E03 - Recap of Last Season

This may be something you want or it may just be adding to the "noise" in the _**Scan**_ tab.

If it is "noise" you can highlight the row (or multiple rows if that fits better) and right click. A cut-down menu appears, if you select "Ignore Selected" the item is removed from the _**Scan**_ results and appears in the "Ignore List".

If, at a later date, you decide you wish to add the item, you can remove it from the Ignore list using the *Edit Ignore List* window, selecting the item in question and clicking `Remove`.
