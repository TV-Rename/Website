## 3. Run a Scan

![Scan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/main-window/scan-01.png){:.pic-c}
1. Go to the _**Scan**_ tab, and click `Full`. TV&nbsp;Rename will download any needed show information from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com"), and compare it with the contents of the media library. Settings in **Options...** will change the behaviour here.

2. When the scan is complete, review TV&nbsp;Rename's suggested changes and other information. Any ticked item will be actioned, so un-tick things you're not sure about, or use the check boxes in the bottom-right of the screen for a less granular approach. Right-click on selected items for more actions.

3. Click `Do Checked` and TV&nbsp;Rename will process the ticked actions, moving and renaming files as necessary.
