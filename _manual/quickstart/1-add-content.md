<!-- START 1 ADD CONTENT --------------------- -->
## 1. Add content from your Media Library

Under normal circumstances you would add a Media Library path when adding a new show to TV&nbsp;Rename, however TV&nbsp;Rename has a trick up its sleeve when adding shows already in the library's folder infrastructure - **Bulk Add Shows**.

1. Follow the menu to **Tools>Bulk&nbsp;Add&nbsp;Shows** and whilst on the _**Folders**_ tab of the newly opened window click `Add`. Browse to the root folder of your "Media Library" and click `OK`. The path will be added to the "Monitor Folders" list.

    If you use multiple disks or paths for your library, repeat the above step for each root path.

2. Click the `Check >>` button, the selected path(s) will be scanned and any content with a recognised structure automatically displayed in the _**Scan Results**_ tab.

3. In the _**Scan Results**_ tab, click `Auto ID All` and TV&nbsp;Rename will attempt to match the found content against [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com"), and ascertain if the show is part of a "flat" structure with all the episodes in one folder, or a "tree" structure with sub folders for each season and specials.

    Any shows not identified will not have an entry in the **Show** column or the **thetvdb code** column; these can be fixed manually by highlighting the relevant row in the table and clicking `Edit` and using `Search` to interrogate [TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com").

4. Once the match process has finished, click `Add & Close` and accept the confirmation, all the identified shows will be added to the _**My Shows**_ tab.

5. _**My Shows**_ will now be populated with the TV shows that have been identified, however there is currently no "Season" information. click `Refresh` and all the season information will be downloaded (depending on the size of your media library this may take a little while).

6. Once the download is complete you can browse the series information. Here, by right clicking on a show or season, you can edit the TV&nbsp;Rename settings to override information fetched from [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com") .

7. You can manually add shows by clicking the `Add` button in the _**My Shows**_ tab. in the *Add/Edit Show* window that appears enter the show name or code in the" [The&nbsp;TVDB](http://thetvdb.com 'Visit thetvdb.com') code:" box and click `Search` to find it.
Hop across to the _**Folders**_ tab and enter the base folder for the show in your media library, and click `OK`.
